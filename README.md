# Lordess-of-the-Flies

This novel take Lord of the Flies by William Golding and changes all the male names and pronouns and changes them to female. I named the text of the book text and used text.replace to replace all the names and pronouns. I sent the output into a text file which I then was able to use weasyprint and markdown to generate it into a pdf. The lines when genreated into the pdf go off the page which is kind of annoyning. Thats the one thing I would change.
